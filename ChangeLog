	* src/e_mod_nav.c (viewport_object_added): Also monitor GeometryChanged
	signals from other neos
	* src/e_mod_nav.c (on_geometry_changed): The new geometry is sent with the
	signal so just parse them instead of querying.

	* src/e_nav_item_neo_other.c (e_nav_world_item_neo_other_add): Sign handling
	of latitude is reversed. Fix this here until someone who knows the code can
	do it properly.

	* src/e_ctrl.c (_e_ctrl_cb_signal_drag),
	src/e_nav.c (e_nav_zoom_set): Use a logarithmic scale for the
	zoom slider
