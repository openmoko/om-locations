Some quick and dirty TODO's

* The base nav background (display a grid - know the co-ordinates and accept
  world long/lat coords. click to drag/scroll plus the ability to set zoom)
* Create generic object container + some basic "dummy" objects to play in
  the nav bg and havt it control on pan and zoom etc.
* Create generic "menu object" - click to pop up cirtular menu. click again
  to pop down, handle menu selection, display and callback and have it attach
  to generic objects.
* Create AP objects that set up menu and display AP info/status
* Crate Neo objects that set up menu and display neo state
* Create the "me" neo object as above but specifically for me
* Create network "signal info" objects - display strength of signal at a given
  point (otherwise not able to interact)
* Create object links used for when you have joined an AP to display what
  you are connected to - could be used for other no's too if done right).

--- now we are at demo stage.

* make location title can be modified
* make list view an indenpendent widget from e_ctrl. 
* make e_ctrl using edje to implement buttons, etc. 
* tag sharing by SMS
